# elite-c holder

This is a elite-c v4 holder for the lolligagger tray mount for [Joshua Shreves
Dactyl Manuform python port](https://github.com/joshreve/dactyl-keyboard) if you
enable ```controller_mount_type = 'EXTERNAL'```.

## Printing

Print it with 0.15mm layer height on a 0.4mm nozzle with stock settings.
Supports are not needed - at least on a Prusa Mini+.
Don't try to pry it off the bed - wait until it is cooled down, otherwise you
will rupture the single layer.
